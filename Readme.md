## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Udesh-Regmi/C_Programming_College_Files
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Lab Folder**:
   Use `cd` to go into the exercise folder:
   ```bash
   cd Lab_Exercise_1
   ```

3. **Compile and Run C Programs**:
   - **Compile** using `gcc`:
     ```bash
     gcc filename.c -o outputname
     ```
   - **Run** the compiled program:
     ```bash
     ./outputname
     ```

   ✅ **Tip**: Replace `filename.c` and `outputname` with your desired C source file and output executable name.
